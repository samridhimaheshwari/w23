# Topics

Code that we'll be working with
* [CS16 final exam solutions (from last lecture)](https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w23/diba-cs16-final-solutions)
* [Buggy student code](https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w23/buggy-cs16-final-demo)

Last lecture, we talked about how to debug using print statements
Today, I'll demo two new debugging tools: gdb and valgrind.
We'll do some exploration with these tools and talk about how a combination of drawing memory diagrams and gdb can help us find bugs in code.
