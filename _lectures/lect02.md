# Code from lecture
We worked through the solutions to the CS16 final exam: [CS16 final exam solutions](https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w23/diba-cs16-final-solutions)

# Topics

We will solve the final exam for CS16 from Fall 2022 as a review of linked list concepts and recursion.

# Pre-class prep
1. Complete the "Get setup with Github" part of lab00: https://ucsb-cs24.github.io/w23/lab/lab00/

2. Read the description of the 3 functions that we will be implementing:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NE5x-oMbf_T52JXRQITjw60Ou66GuO3COLKzFhxsIvg/edit?usp=sharing

3. Review linked lists from CS16 using the guide below:
* Why linked list? Array (doesn't really work because fixed size). Better options: vector and linked list
* Implement a linked list (C-style) no classes, focussing on the concept of creating and modifying a linked chain
* Create an empty list and write a function to append a new node to the linked list
* Print the elements of the list: key concept includes iterating over the nodes of the linked list using a traversal pointer
* Write linked list functions that use recursion: recursively print values, clear all nodes, delete a particular value
